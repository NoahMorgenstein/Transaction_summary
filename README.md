# Transaction_summary
Transactions for two-week period

A potential client is considering taking us onboard as their direct mail partner and data analytics resource. LS Direct prides itself on not only being able to bring high levels of incremental return on advertising spend, but also doing detailed analyses on how our clients are performing.

This client has asked for a relatively open-ended analysis to better understand trends within their data and think we can help. They sent us two weeks of their transactions in early June 2023 broken out into three CSVs:

* Transactions - a list of all transactions from June 1 - June 14, 2023 at all of their stores
* Products - a list of all products with their product names, categories and prices
* Stores - store IDs with their accompanying city and state

Your task here is to spend no more than 2 hours on analyzing this data and sending a summary email to our internal team and the client. This should be a very preliminary analysis with some visuals and tables (if appropriate). We want to provide some insight, but also want to be mindful of not going down rabbit holes. So, please spend no more than 2 hours on analyzing the data and no more than 1 hour on the summary emails. Feel free to use any language or program you choose for the analysis and emails.

In your summary email to the internal team, make sure to highlight:

* Your process for analyzing this with links to resources used
* Key findings and trends
* Alist of questions we have for the client
* Potential next steps 

This email will go to our Data Team leadership as well as the Sales team, who should feel prepared to speak to the client with your email. The more detail the better.

In your summary email to the client, make sure to highlight:

* Key findings and trends
* Potential next steps 

The client should feel assured that we are a strong resource for helping them better understand their data. But, simplicity and clarity is key! Donâ€™t go into as much detail as the internal email.
